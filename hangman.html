  //Modernizr is a JavaScript library to detect extra features of a browser.It helps to give features in older browsers.I am using this to support my game in almost all browsers.

  //Instead of loading JS files directly with html I am using Modernizr
   
  Modernizr.load(
      
    {
         //load is a property of load method of Modernizr
         //This simply loads required JS files

         load: ['js/jquery.min.js','js/hangman.js'],

         //complete is a property of load method that executes a function after all JS files have been loaded

         complete: function(){
            init();

       Hangman is a word-guessing game. Click or tap New Game to display the letters of the alphabet and a row of dashes indicating the number of letters to be guessed. Click or tap a letter. If it's in the word, it replaces the dash(es). Each wrong guess results in a stroke being added to a gallows and its victim. Your role is to guess the word correctly before the victim meets his grisly fate.
